# homemade_saved_html_file_scraper

I had to save the first page of the website i wanted to scrape, in order to debug it mannually, 
so I could actually run my python script on it, to extract the wanted json file.

-- Kill_bill_1.html 
Features the first partially debugged HTML file, 
almost usable for the scraper. Using the python script in terminal to debug the HTML file.

-- Kill_bill_2.html 
Features the second, completely debugged HTML file, which works in the scraper. 
No more errors in terminal!

--reference_scraper_files.py
Features my adjusted/homebuild python script to scrape html-files saved on my computer.
